	<p id="descrip">Daniel Gerhard "Dan" Brown is an American author of thriller 
	fiction who is best known for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code. Brown's novels are 
	treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period, and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, 
	symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as 
	of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), 
	and Inferno (2013), have been adapted into films.<br><br>
	Brown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and 
	Christianity as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website 
	that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and 
	says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual 
	discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be used "as a positive catalyst for introspection 
	and exploration of our faith."</p>
